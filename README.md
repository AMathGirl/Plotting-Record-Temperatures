# Plotting temperatures using matplotlib
In the notebook, I extracted the highest and lowest temperatures recorded in New Orleans for each day of the year over the 
period 2005-2014 and then plotted them using matplotlib. Then I also added record breaking temperatures for the year 2015 and 
cleaned up the graph to make it look nice.
