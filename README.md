# Plotting temperatures using matplotlib
In the notebook, the highest and lowest temperatures for New Orleans is extracted for each day of the year over the 
period 2005-2014. These highs and lows are plotted as line graphs using *matplotlib* and then record breaking temperatures for the year 2015 is added as scatter-plot over the above graph. Both the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales are included in the graph as the right and left y-axis; the days of the year are represented on the x-axis as month labels centrally placed between the ticks. The verbal description in terms of legends, labels and title is minimalist, and every aspect of the graph, including color palette, is carefully chosen to convey information visually. The intention is to make the graph concise, accurate and informative. 

The data used can be found at The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Daily Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN-Daily) and it contains contains daily climate records coming from the 12 stations near *New Orleans, Louisiana, United States* over the period from Jan 01, 2005 to Dec 31, 2015.
