# Plotting temperatures using matplotlib
In the notebook, I extracted the highest and lowest temperatures recorded in New Orleans for each day of the year over the 
period 2005-2014 and then plotted them using matplotlib. Then I also added record breaking temperatures for the year 2015 and 
cleaned up the graph to make it look nice.

The data can be found at The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Daily Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN-Daily) and it contains contains daily climate records coming from the 12 stations near *New Orleans, Louisiana, United States* over the period from Jan 01, 2005 to Dec 31, 2015.
